This a python module for using Vimeo's API.

This fork is a third complete rewrite, including cutting down the code from
around 1000 lines to 200, making it a bit more pythonic, and ripping out
curl and oauth in favor of the newer oauth2 (which happens to wrap httplib2).
python-oauth2 can be found here (http://github.com/simplegeo/python-oauth2)
and should be the only requirement as of the last update to this readme.

INSTALL
-------

Distutil's install hasn't been written yet and I wouldn't use anything that's
provided in the main branch's repo for this. Everything that you need is in
the __init__.py module in the "vimeo" folder, so just place that folder 
somewhere in your python path for now.

STATUS
------

Just about everything in the Advanced API should work. You'll need to
provide your API key and secret. The module by default looks for it in settings.py
but change that to wherever you'd like. 

I'm currently in the process of testing uploading, I'm guessing it mostly works
and might just need some gentle coercing. I need to check if there's a progress
bar or similar support in httplib2, otherwise I guess when I get the chance
that's one thing to be implemented. If you encounter any other API methods with
unexpected behavior that you think is due to the module, please let me know
(preferrably by filing an issue ticket).

USAGE
-----

Everything right now flows through the VimeoClient class. Instantiate, then 
if you want to call API methods that require authentication, call the provided
get_request_token, get_authorization_url and get_access_token methods to do
the 3-legged authentication. Or if you already have an access token pass it in
to the VimeoClient constructor. Also, if you're using this module with django
like I am, the oauth2 docs have a quick example (using twitter which has the
same authorization process just about) that you can take a look at for 3-legged
authorization. For unauthenticated API calls, you're good to go right after
instantiating.

To call API methods the syntax is easy: find the path to the method in the API
documentation, and call the method on the VimeoClient instance using the full 
path, separated by underscores (not periods!). Pass any parameters in by 
keyword. See the example:

To call the vimeo >> videos >> getInfo method:

    v = VimeoClient()
    v.vimeo_videos_getInfo(video_id="5775787")

You can control the output format of the response by either passing in a format
argument to the initializer or by using the .default_response_property. See the
docstring (json is recommended for quick lookup as it returns a python dict).
