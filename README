This a python module for using Vimeo's API.

I've pretty much rewritten all of it again with this fork, cutting down the 
code, making it a bit more pythonic, and ripping out the curl and oauth
pieces of it in favor of the newer oauth2 (which happens to wrap httplib2).
python-oauth2 can be found here on github and should be the only requirement
(though I haven't double checked yet, still doing some work on the code).

INSTALL
-------

If you'd like to install, I wouldn't use anything that's provided in the repo
here, it's leftover from the fork that I haven't rewritten yet. All that works
is currently located in __init__.py, so just place that module wherever you'd 
like for now.

USAGE
-----

I haven't tested uploading, which I'd guess won't work but shouldn't be hard
to coerce. Everything else in the Advanced API should work. You'll need to
provide your Key and Secret. The module by default looks for it in settings.py
but change that to wherever you'd like. 

Everything right now flows through the VimeoClient class. Instantiate, then 
authorization and tokening should be handled using the .client attribute (which
is an instantiated oauth2.Client instance). See the Vimeo API for the steps you 
need to take and the oauth2 docs for how to take them (if you're doing this in
django like I am it was all of 4 lines of code. The oauth2 docs have a twitter
example that is just about exactly the same process). I'll update this file
with better instructions just in case when I get the chance.

To call API methods (including those that do not require the above 
authentication) the syntax is easy: just call the method on the VimeoClient
instance using the full path to the method from the API, replacing the "."'s
with "_". Pass parameters in by keyword. See the example:

To call the vimeo.videos.getInfo method:

    v = VimeoClient()
    v.vimeo_videos_getInfo(video_id="5775787")
